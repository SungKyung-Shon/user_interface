# User Interface for Enhanced Human-Aware Robot Navigation

## Project Overview
The project is about developing robots for effective path-searching around humans in a virtual environment. This project’s initial goal was to acquire a scored trajectory dataset and train a model that exploits the dataset. Training the aforementioned deep learning model requires data to train it on. Specifically, recordings of trajectories along subjects’ opinions on them. The project involved a survey for people to rate the robot’s movement. Given recordings of robot trajectories, participants were asked to assess the quality using a numeric scale. 

## Dataset
The research utilizes the SocNavGym dataset (https://github.com/gnns4hri/SocNavGym).
